mooc-standards
==============

This repository contains a set of properties of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). 
This is currently WIP, but should become an open micro standard for MOOC-Providers as well as Course search engines for MOOCs.
The openHPI-Team took a look at big MOOC providers, online course search websites and existing standards.
We found out important and often used properties and write them down in a table (mooc-microstandard.xls).
Afterwards we used the schema of schema.org to fit the properties in a formal way.

To provide you an easy way to use this standard, we include a sample course in this repository.
This sample course is represented in two forms: 
	- One in schema.org form (sampleCourse.html Just open it with a text editor.)
	- Another in JSON format

What you can do
---------------

This mooc-standard is not finished yet.
If you have any annotations for instance at your opinion a property should be renamed or we should add some properties, just request an issue on this github repository or drop an mail to jan.renz@hpi.de
