mooc-standards
==============

This repository contains a set of properties of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). 
This is currently WIP, but should become an open micro standard for MOOC-Providers as well as Course search engines for MOOCs.
The openHPI-Team took a look at big MOOC providers, online course search websites and existing standards.
We found out important and often used properties and collected them in a table (mooc-microstandard-research.xls).

Afterwards we used the schema of schema.org to fit the properties in a formal way (mooc-microstandard-types.xls).

To provide you an easy way to read and contribute to this standard, we include a sample course in this repository.
This sample course is represented in three forms: 
* sampleCourse.html - schema.org HTML format (Just open it with a text editor.)
* sampleCourse.json - JSON format
* sampleCourse.xml - XML format + XSD file 

What you can do
---------------

This mooc-standard is not finished yet.
If you have any remarks, requests/suggestions for new properties or renaming properties, please request an issue on this github repository or drop an email to jan.renz@hpi.de or thomas.staubitz@hpi.de
